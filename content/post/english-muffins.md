These English muffins made me realize I liked English muffins. Grocery store ones just have, that...taste? Maybe some bitterness or something? Anyway, these don't. They're super flavorful and not too time consuming. This recipe is based on [BA's best English muffins](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bas-best-english-muffins) but due to a typo (or something?) their recipe is nonsense. It is 108% hydration. That is not a dough, that is a batter. If you actually made their recipe you would get pancakes. I adapted it to bring it to a reasonable hydration (80%) & add 100g sourdough starter.

> If you don't have starter, just add 50g of flour and 50g of water to the recipe

**Yield:** About 12, I think? Maybe 14. I can't remember.

**Time:** 30 minutes -> Overnight -> 2h in the morning.

**Dough**

- 100g mature sourdough starter, the fruitier the better
- 108g water @ 80f
- 370g bread flour (this recipe is high hydration, if you don't have bread flour, you may want to reduce the water)
- 2tsp instant yeast
- 168g buttermilk, warmed (I didn't have any buttermilk -- I made a very DIY buttermilk with water, dried milk powder, and vinegar. YMMV)
- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 tbsp sugar

I didn't really change anything from BA's method, so this is abbreivated. In case of confusion, just follow the link/video above.

### Make the Dough
1. Mix it all together in a stand mixer. Add the liquid first, as always, to avoid getting stuff stuck to the sides ~ 5 minutes.

2. Transfer to bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

### Divide and Shape
1. Divide into 3oz portions.
2. Because this dough is so wet, I prefer a pull-and-fold method as opposed the the way I would normally shape rolls (stretching over my thumbs) -- see the video. Basically, go around in circle grabbing a small segment and folding it over to the center. Repeat until taut. With a bench scraper, flip, then shape like a mini boule: drag 1", rotate 90 degrees, repeat, until it's standing tall and proud on the counter.
> The recipe says cornmeal which I don't have. I used a 50/50 blend of rice and bread flour which works well in almost every situation

Place shaped muffins onto sheet pans lined with parchment paper and floured. I used Amazon basics Silpat.

3. Let sit at room temp (76f) until doubled in size (60-70 minutes)

### Griddle & Bake

1. Preheat oven to 350
2. In a skillet, griddle, whatever, over low heat, cook the muffins until golden brown ~ 5-7 minutes on the each side. Transfer to oven and bake 5-10 more minutes.
3. Allow to cool 30 minutes.

### Storage
I froze these. It was _ok_ but to be honest, you loose some of the texture. They are still delicious, but its probably best to just eat them fresh!
